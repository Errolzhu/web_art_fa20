         <p>CSS has come a long way, but min(), max(), and clamp() make a lot of things a lot easier than they used to be, and really open up the world of responsive typography like we never had before! Clamp() is the ingredient that we've needed for a long time to really be able to make type fully responsive in our CSS, and to be able to do it on one line is absolute magic!</p>
