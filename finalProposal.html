<body>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
        <h5><b>1.Brief Description</b></h5>
        <p>A further develop of "useless java" code.<em>(I fell in love with that cat doing punch thing)</em> <br>Aiming at by detecting user's mouse actions with response <em>(planning using memes)</em>. </p>

        <h5><b>2.Use beyond class?</b></h5>
        <p>Probably not?... Will put in future portfolio depend on the degree of completion. <em> <br>(and probably would be a website that dont know how to use in the first place)</em></p>

        <h5><b>3.Use in portfolio?</b></h5>
        <p>Will put in future portfolio depend on the degree of completion.</p>

        <h5><b>4.Chance to experiment?</b></h5>
        <p>Yes. but also not having the idea to make a portfolio entry.(or maybe it could be?). <br> Want to first focus on interaction parts then think about the use.</p>
        
        <h5><b>5.large or small?</b></h5>
        <p>I think it's closer to multiple small actions.</p>


    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <h5><b>1.Why want to? Hope to learn?</b></h5>
    <p> I want to make a website that looks simple, using letter emoji(drawing emotion in Japanese), interactable, and also to show coding ability. 
        <br>I want to express the freedom and un-restrained-ness(if it is a word) , <em>(also try to become a part of the meme culture.)</em></p>
    
    <h5><b>2.Primary concern?</b></h5>
    <p>The way to detect mouse behave. Right now in my head, I am hope it could distinguish at least single clickï¼Œdouble click, multiple click, and hold & drag. However, I have no idea what library I should use, or should i mmake the function from scratch. I have the idea on how to use it with engines like unity.(so c+ i guess), but not sure how to convert that into java.</P>

    <h5><b>3.Reference website</b></h5>
    <p>Hmmmmmm...still......trying to find(whispering)...</p>



    <h2>Technical</h2>
    <h5>1.Technical/code concepts</h5>
    <p> Detect timing.
        <br>I find there is a "dragstart" "dragend" function in html.
        <br>onMouseMove function.
        <br>also include short audio. *!forgot to ask about compact audio last time. 
    </p>

    
    <h5>2.can i imagine</h5>
    <p>I am absolutely dream small this time.(can't believe I am saying tis proudly). I want to dream small but also focus on small parts and include more sensitive detail.</p>
